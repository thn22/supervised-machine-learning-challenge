# supervised-machine-learning-challenge
## Description of the Project
For this project, I was tasked to create two machine learning models to determine the risk level of certain loans. I will be comparing the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models to identify which loans would be best for investors to back. 


## Languages and Libraries
